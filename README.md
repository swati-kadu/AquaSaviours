## Short description

### What's the problem?

Water is most essential, limited and invaluable resource available on earth. A drop of water is worth more than a sack of gold to a thirsty man. As the population is increasing the water needs are also increasing hence as a world citizen it is important for us to save water by all means. As a resident I should have access to all the water saving techniques and I should be motivated to do the same. To inculcate this habit technology can be used by providing all the required help and motivation to continue saving water by all means. To save water one needs to know their daily water consumption and then make a plan to reduce it consciously. You also need advice from experts to save water efficiently. Recycling used water is expensive but saving water at individual level is less expensive and contributes to more fresh water availability.

### How can technology help?

Residents can get to know their daily, monthly and yearly water consumption by using sensor based IOT devices. Residents can also interact with a chatbot that can provide all the required information like where the consumption is more, recommendations on how to save more water etc. Residents can also compete with each other through gamification dashboard where each saving will add to points their by encouraging resident to save more water. Residents can also interact with experts to gain more knowledge on water saving techniques. 

### The idea

Our idea promotes saving of water by allowing residents to view their water consumption using IOT devices. Residents can also track their progress through gamification dashboard which will show their position in water saving as compared to other residents. Residents can interact with a chatbot backed by IBM Watson Assistant that can provide all the required information like where the consumption is more, recommendations on how to save more water etc. Residents are  encoured to resolve leakages issues on priority. Residents can also interact with experts and capture photos and post of facebook for creating awareness about water saving. The IOT devices can also help get information on water purity.
Apart from above certain IOT device which stop the flow can be used to switch off supply from main inlets when residents are going on vacation. The vaction mode will save water incase residents forget to close taps when there was no supply and when supply resumes the water start overflowing causing a lot of wastage.
The main focus of our idea remains on helping each resident save as much water as they can by providing access to all the required information. The data collected from IOT devices is maintained in IBM cloud and Cognos is used to generate the required graphs for gamification.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-16b4lPfpVRo5neZz-i7O9f1qBQGeZ4D/view?usp=sharing)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Long description

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
